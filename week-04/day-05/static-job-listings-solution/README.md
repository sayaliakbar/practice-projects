## What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to apply advanced React concepts like component composition, state management with **Zustand**, and building reusable components like the `FilterBar` and `Job` components. Additionally, integrating Tailwind CSS streamlined the styling process and allowed for rapid prototyping.

Hereâ€™s an example of the reusable `Card` component for job listings:

```jsx
<div className="bg-white rounded-sm sm:border-l-2 drop-shadow-lg border-primary-cyan flex py-4 px-5 gap-4">
  <img src={job.logo} alt={job.company} />
  <div>
    <h1>{job.position}</h1>
    <span>{job.contract}</span>
  </div>
</div>
```
