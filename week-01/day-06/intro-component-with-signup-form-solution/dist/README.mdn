## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript for form validation
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce several concepts, including:

1. **Form Validation**:
   Using JavaScript to validate inputs, such as checking for empty fields and validating email format with a regex:

   ```js
   function validateEmail(email) {
     const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
     return emailRegex.test(email);
   }
   ```

2. **Tailwind CSS for Styling**:
   Leveraging utility classes for responsive design, hover states, and error indicators.

   ```html
   <input
     class="border border-solid p-4 rounded-lg w-full hover:border-black/100"
     type="text"
     placeholder="First Name"
     name="firstName"
   />
   ```

### Continued development

Future focus areas:
- Enhancing accessibility by ensuring proper ARIA attributes.
- Exploring more advanced validation techniques, such as debouncing for real-time email validation.
- Adding animations for better user experience.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Helped me understand and utilize Tailwind classes effectively.
- [MDN Web Docs: Form Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - Great resource for understanding form validation basics.
