# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution

This is my solution to the [QR Code Component Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). This challenge helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills by creating a visually appealing and responsive QR code component.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Google Fonts for typography

### What I Learned

This project allowed me to practice creating a clean, responsive layout using Flexbox. I also improved my understanding of semantic HTML and how to apply consistent styling with CSS custom properties. Here's a small snippet of CSS I implemented:

```css
.card {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 20px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued Development

I plan to focus on the following areas in future projects:

- Improving accessibility for screen readers.
- Enhancing responsiveness for different screen sizes.
- Experimenting with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Comprehensive guides on HTML and CSS.
- [CSS-Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped with understanding Flexbox layouts.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - To find and use beautiful fonts.
