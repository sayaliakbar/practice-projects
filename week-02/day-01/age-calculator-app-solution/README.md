# Frontend Mentor - Age Calculator App Solution

This is my solution to the [Age Calculator App Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q). Frontend Mentor challenges provide an excellent opportunity to improve coding skills by working on realistic projects.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View their age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form.
- Receive validation feedback if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted.
  - The day number is not between 1-31.
  - The month number is not between 1-12.
  - The year is in the future.
  - The entered date is invalid (e.g., 31/04/1991, as April has 30 days).
- Experience an optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- Interact with hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
- **Bonus Feature**: See the age numbers animate to their final values when the form is submitted.

## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5** for semantic markup.
- **CSS3** with custom properties and a mobile-first workflow.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** for form validation and DOM manipulation.
- Responsive design for seamless viewing across devices.

### What I Learned

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of:

- Validating form inputs using JavaScript.
- Handling edge cases like invalid or incomplete dates.
- Dynamically manipulating the DOM to provide real-time feedback.
- Tailoring layouts for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.

#### Code Snippets

**Date Validation in JavaScript:**

```js
function isValidDate(day, month, year) {
  const date = new Date(year, month - 1, day);
  return (
    date.getDate() === parseInt(day) &&
    date.getMonth() + 1 === parseInt(month) &&
    date.getFullYear() === parseInt(year)
  );
}
```

**Dynamic Age Calculation:**

```js
function calculateAge(day, month, year) {
  const birthDate = new Date(year, month - 1, day);
  const today = new Date();
  let years = today.getFullYear() - birthDate.getFullYear();
  let months = today.getMonth() - birthDate.getMonth();
  let days = today.getDate() - birthDate.getDate();

  if (days < 0) {
    months--;
    days += new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), 0).getDate();
  }
  if (months < 0) {
    years--;
    months += 12;
  }
  return { years, months, days };
}
```

### Continued Development

Future improvements include:

- Adding animations for better UX, particularly for the bonus feature.
- Implementing accessibility enhancements like ARIA labels for screen readers.
- Optimizing the JavaScript for larger, more complex projects.
