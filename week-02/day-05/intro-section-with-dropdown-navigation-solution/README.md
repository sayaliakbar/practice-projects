# Frontend Mentor - Intro Section with Dropdown Navigation Solution

This is my solution to the [Intro Section with Dropdown Navigation Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5). It was a great opportunity to apply responsive design principles and practice interactive navigation using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Overview

### The Challenge

The goal was to create a responsive landing page where users can:

- View dropdown menus when interacting with navigation links on both desktop and mobile.
- Experience an optimal layout tailored to their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements.

## Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5**: For clean, structured content.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To create a responsive, utility-first design.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For toggling dropdown menus and managing interactivity.
- **Mobile-First Workflow**: Ensured smooth responsiveness.

### Key Learnings

Here are a few things I learned while building this project:

1. **Dropdown Menu Interactions**:  
   Implementing dropdowns using `classList` manipulation for showing and hiding elements dynamically.
   ```js
   function toggleSubMenu(state, subMenu, downArrow, upArrow) {
     if (!state) {
       subMenu.classList.remove("hidden");
       subMenu.classList.add("flex");
       downArrow.classList.add("hidden");
       upArrow.classList.remove("hidden");
     } else {
       subMenu.classList.remove("flex");
       subMenu.classList.add("hidden");
       downArrow.classList.remove("hidden");
       upArrow.classList.add("hidden");
     }
     return !state;
   }
   ```
2. **Responsive Design with Tailwind**:  
   Utilizing utility classes like `flex`, `hidden`, and responsive breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) made styling easier and faster.

### Areas for Improvement

- **Animation**: Add smooth transitions for opening and closing dropdowns for better user experience.
- **Accessibility**: Enhance focus states and improve keyboard navigation.
- **Reusable Code**: Refactor JavaScript to reduce duplication and improve readability.
