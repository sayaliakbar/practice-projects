# Introduction to Algorithms and Time Complexity

## üìö What is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is simply a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a specific problem. Think of it like a recipe for baking a cake or a checklist to assemble furniture. In coding, algorithms help us write efficient programs to solve problems like searching for an item in a list, sorting data, or finding the shortest route between two points.

## ‚è±Ô∏è What is Time Complexity?

When we write an algorithm, we want to know how much time it will take to complete. **Time complexity** measures how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows.

For example:

- Searching for your name in a list of 10 names takes less time than searching in a list of 1,000 names.
- Sorting 100 numbers takes less time than sorting 10,000 numbers.

Time complexity is expressed using **Big O Notation**, which gives us an idea of the algorithm's performance as the input size grows larger.

## Why is Time Complexity Important?

In real-world applications:

- **Efficiency matters**: Faster algorithms save time and computing resources.
- **Scalability**: Some algorithms work well for small inputs but become too slow for large inputs.

Imagine you're building a shopping app:

- Searching for products quickly is critical for a good user experience.
- Sorting thousands of items by price should be efficient.

Understanding time complexity helps you choose the right approach for your problem.

## Examples of Time Complexities

Here are some common time complexities with real-life analogies:

| Time Complexity | Description      | Analogy                                                           |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **O(1)**        | Constant time    | Finding the first page of a book ‚Äî you just open the cover.       |
| **O(n)**        | Linear time      | Reading a book page by page.                                      |
| **O(n^2)**      | Quadratic time   | Comparing every page in one book with every page in another book. |
| **O(log n)**    | Logarithmic time | Searching for a word in a dictionary by dividing it into halves.  |

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Examples

### Example 1: Linear Time Complexity (O(n))

This algorithm checks if a number exists in a list by looking at each item one by one:

```javascript
function findNumberLinear(arr, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === target) {
      return `Found ${target} at index ${i}`;
    }
  }
  return `${target} not found.`;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findNumberLinear([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)); // Found 3 at index 2
```

````

- **Explanation**: The algorithm checks each element one by one until it finds the target. If there are 5 items, it might check all 5. This makes the time complexity **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array.

---

### Example 2: Quadratic Time Complexity (O(n^2))

This algorithm compares every element with every other element to check for duplicates:

```javascript
function hasDuplicates(arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] === arr[j]) {
        return true; // Duplicate found
      }
    }
  }
  return false; // No duplicates
}

// Example usage:
console.log(hasDuplicates([1, 2, 3, 4, 2])); // true
console.log(hasDuplicates([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // false
```

- **Explanation**: The algorithm compares every element with every other element. If the list has 5 items, it might perform up to 10 comparisons (5 √ó 2). This makes the time complexity **O(n^2)**.

## üåü How to Improve Time Complexity?

Sometimes, we can rewrite an algorithm to make it more efficient. Here's an optimized version of the duplicate-checking algorithm:

```javascript
function hasDuplicatesOptimized(arr) {
  const seen = new Set();
  for (let num of arr) {
    if (seen.has(num)) {
      return true; // Duplicate found
    }
    seen.add(num);
  }
  return false; // No duplicates
}

// Example usage:
console.log(hasDuplicatesOptimized([1, 2, 3, 4, 2])); // true
console.log(hasDuplicatesOptimized([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // false
```

- **Explanation**: Instead of comparing every element with every other element, we use a **Set** to track numbers we‚Äôve seen. This reduces the time complexity to **O(n)**.
